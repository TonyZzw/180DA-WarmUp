1. Using HSV color space is typically more effective than RGB for tracking objects in varying lighting conditions. 
The cam tracks a dark blue object by setting a wide HSV threshold range, lower_blue = np.array([100, 100, 0]) and upper_blue = np.array([140, 255, 255]). 
It isolates the object using color thresholding, finds contours, and draws a bounding box around the largest contour.

2. The tracking ability of the object is impacted by lighting changes: 
it decreases in very bright conditions and fails in very low light.

3. Adjusting the phone's brightness affects the tracking ability: 
increasing brightness makes tracking harder, while very low brightness leads to poor and unstable tracking.

4. I used a blue sticky note and a mobile phone as experimental objects. 
Changing the lighting conditions around the sticky note slightly alters the brightness of its color. 
However, changing the lighting conditions around the mobile phone does not have a noticeable effect on its color.
