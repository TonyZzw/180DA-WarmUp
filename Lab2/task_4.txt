1. MQTT enables efficient message broadcasting to multiple users on a single network. However, 
it's challenging to identify the sender of a particular message and to store messages for later retrieval, 
as messages do not persist on the network. A typical communications lag time with MQTT could be around 0.5 seconds. 
Due to our project's web service will be built by Node.JS, we will consider MQTT as alternative method.

2.
* Yes

* The length of a phrase is less of an issue for accuracy, 
but clarity and distinctiveness of speech are important factors.

* Works as expect. Don't need to improve.

a) Distinguish between simple command instructions, e.g. up, down, left and right
b) We expect simple speech recognition, basically single word oriented
c) We only need to be able to distinguish simple words. Because we are a turn-based game, 
we don't need to have a particularly fast reaction time, and it won't affect the progress of the game.
d) I think the current hardware is sufficient.
